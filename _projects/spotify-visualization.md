## By Joseph Gozum

While looking for a job after grad school, in my free time I wanted to use Python more. So I found that I could download my data that Spotify collects and using the Pandas mondule, I figured out how to process the JSON files that Spotify gives and use Pandas to analyze the data. 

Using the files Spotify gives, I found out how many new songs I listened to each month between October 2020 and September 2021.
