## Section 1: Code
This should be a serious more in depth description of the project. Describe what technologies you used. Talk about the "problem". Talk about your process to solve the problem. Describe any mishaps or problems.[^1]

Maybe show some sample data:
```
    "name": "Helper",
    "description": "The json structure"
```
Or some python snippets:
```
    var code = "Hello World!"
```
## Section 2: Results
Include some pictures like this ![Mm, tacos](/assets/imgs/tacos.jpg)
They're all gonna be centered, rounded off, and this approximate width.

Talk about the results. Talk about how you could possibly expand this project in the future or what you would do differently. ~~The world is flat.~~[^2]
