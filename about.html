<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>I'm a recent graduate looking for an entry-level position to begin my career and further my practical experience. But aside from that, in my personal time I enjoy reading books and watching movies in my free time! You can probably also catch me watching TV while enjoying
popcorn chicken and milk tea.</p>

<h3> Low-cost Phasor Measurement Unit — Master’s Project</h3><div class="date">Sept 2020 - May 2021</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a Phasor Measurement Unit to calculate the magnitude and phase of three-phase power systems</li>
        <li>Simulated interfacing with  three-phase power with analog frontend in circuit simulations</li>
        <li>Simulated interfacing with  three-phase power with analog frontend in circuit simulations</li>
        <li>Used readily available microcontroller development boards and off the shelf components to construct</li>
        <li>Created a prototype phasor measurement unit using off the shelf components for less than $300</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Impedance-based Battery Management System — Undergraduate Project</h3><div class="date">Sept 2018 - May 2019</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed a battery health monitoring system with senior project group to calculate impedance of Lithium-ion batteries</li>
        <li>Sent a square pulse to a battery and measured its response over a low resistance load. Decompose the response to its frequency components and calculate the impedance from those components.</li>
        <li>Design, simulation, and physical implementation of current injection circuitry and differential components</li>
        <li>Created a monitoring system that could report the impedance of a Lithium-ion battery for a specified frequency which can be used to derive health status</li>
    </ul>
