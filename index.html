	<h1>Hi there, I'm Joseph Gozum!</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Joseph Gozum and I'm currently a fourth year Electrical Engineering Undergrad! 
    	   Some current interests of mine revolve around Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision, Web Development, and Internet-of-Things.
      	   Aside from that, I enjoy reading books and watching movies in my free time! You can probably also catch me watching TV while enjoying
      	   popcorn chicken and milk tea.
